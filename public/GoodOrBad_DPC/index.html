      Telling the difference between good and bad is a core skill of being a programmer.....but what if pretty much everyone is just bad at this core skill? Or at the very least nowhere near as good as they would like to think?
      How can we either learn to better at telling the difference, or live with this disability if we can't.
      Telling the difference between good and bad software is hard, lets start with something easier.
      Something physical that can be held, as that should easier to reason about.

        I pretty much had similar opinions when the iPod was launched. The market was saturated with MP3 players, and I thought that Apple might be able to sell a few iPods, but it wasn't obvious to me that it was going to be a great money maker.

  <h2>Why this talk</h2>
  <p>
    Some still saw the iPhone as bad:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>can't even replace the battery</li>
    <li>can't even put a memory card in it</li>
    <li>can't even send MMS at launch.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some thought the iPhone was only selling well for the wrong reasons:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>First smart phone to the market. (sic)</li>
    <li>Apple products sell well just because they look good.</li>
    <li>Apple spends more on marketing than other companies.</li>
    <li>Iphone owners are sheep who buy it just because it's popular</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
    I want to explain why I'm giving this talk.

    After the iPhone had launched and it was selling really well, people were still trying to argue that it was shit.

    And it did have things that you could point at and say "this isn't very good"

    Some people people arguing that is wasn't a very good phone, and that it was only selling well for the "wrong" reasons.

    This is for a device that a _lot_ of people obviously liked.

    And they weren't that calm about their dislike.

        Programmers like to think of themselves as coldly logical and rational beings
        </p>
        But we get bored of using current technology and want to start using new stuff.



          <!--
        Fun story - the last place I worked we were evaluating what technology we should be using for the project.

        One of the senior programmers suggested we should use Neo4J as it's FAST.

        Me: Do we really need fast?

        Them: We could serve 10s of thousands of requests a second if we used it!

        We then did some work to figure out how many requests we needed to server per second.

        It turns out that the highest the load would be is less than 1 request per second.

        Choosing the most boring technology that fits your need is almost always going to be the right choice.

    Math is hard
  </div>
  <aside class="notes">
    So the other main cause of people not being able to tell the difference between good and bad is that math is hard.

    And I do mean math singular - I don't mean maths in general I mean very specifically:

    Counting up numbers in your hard is really, really, really hard.

    Humans can cope with reasonable numbers like 1 or 2. But start to struggle with big numbers like 4 or 5.

    And our brains just completely fail to process ridiculously large numbers like 216 million.

    English has a hilariously inconsistent. Other languages are much more consistent internally. A lot of this is due to English having taken ideas from other languages

    This is very similar to how PHP is not as consistent internally as it could be. This isn't from 'mistakes' this is from a decision to have thin wrappers around the underlying functions, so that people who are familiar with them can use them.

  <h2>English lacks features</h2>

  <p>Most European languages have a polite and informal way of saying 'you'.</p>

  <aside class="notes">

    French has a feature. French has a feature where you can refer to someone formally with 'vous' or you can refer to them more informally with 'tu

    This is great, it allows you to show that you're being polite! Right!

    Features are great right? Having more features makes something better right?

    English doesn't have this feature. We used to have it, with the words 'thee' and 'thou' but they mostly fell out of use during the 1xth century, at least in part due to imported printing presses not having the letter 'thorn', but a y kind of looks like an off-centre thorn.

    The process for English acquiring a new word is "We'll have that. Thanks".

    Most other languages have acadamies that discuss introducing new words after years of discussions, or spend decades changing spellings.

    If nothing looks out of place, then adding new ideas doesn't make people feel surprised.

    PHP started off as a purely procedural language.

    Grew into classes.

    This are the rules for determining if you should use tu or vous.

    The problem with this feature is that you can piss people off by getting it wrong. Pretty obviously tu'ing someone when they think they deserve a vous would wind them up.

    But you can piss people off the other way round as well. My Dad has retired to Normandy, in France. My French is terrible, and I find it much easier to say s'il vous plait.....so I tend to just use that rather than trying to figure out of I should be using the vous or the tu form.

    My Dad's girlfriend got a bit annoyed once when I said "S'il vous plait" instead of switching to the informal s'il te plait, because she thought I was trying to mark her as 'not family'.

    So, to close a loop, after learning all we have learned, lets look back and see if we can see why the iPod and iPhone were successful.

    Let me clear itunes was not good software, and is not good software now, but it was good enough.

    It allowed someone to put a CD in their computer and a few minutes later that music was on their iPod.

    The software that came with most Mp3 players at the time didn't include CD ripping software, so users had to rip a CD with one piece of software, and then load it to the MP3 with a different piece of software.

    And the iPhone ?

    Even though all the other android phones were powerful enough to theoretically have smoother displays, because if the lack of

    <p>And the second thing we found was that yarn doesn't work quite as well as NPM. The issue mainly is that most JS library developers use NPM, not Yarn, so they don't test their libraries with Yarn. And actually don't care if their library works with Yarn or not.</p>

    <p>
      So the decision we made was correct at the time, for the things we based the decision on. But now it was clearly the wrong decision based on things we found out about later.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the risk of being cynical, the main reason for not doing this is that it protects senior people making decisions from being shown to be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protecting senior people in an organisation from being shown to be wrong, is one of the classic ways of an organistion starting to die.

  <aside class="notes">
    Be prepared to be wrong. Particular around choosing libraries and frameworks....there is an incredibly high chance that whatever you choose is just not going to be the right choice....so write your code so that as much of it as possible is decoupled from _any_ library. (that includes your own libraries).

    Brucie bonus - this is very likely to make your code easier to test as well.

    a good way to measure this is to keep asking - if we removed this library how much of the other code would we need to alter - aka I fucking hate active record/eloquent.

    If you're not good at something, spend less time doing it.

    Spend less time making decisions. Which of the following scenarios is likely to have the best result for the

    i) A committee of 5 people spend a week choosing which library to use.
    ii) A single person spends 5 weeks choosing which library to use.
    iii) A single person spend 5 minutes choosing which library to use, and then spending the next 5 weeks trying it out......then finding out what it wrong with it, and realising that what you need from that library is quite different from what you thought was important.

  <p>53!!ONE!!! different models.</p>

  <p>List from http://nokiamuseum.info/category/launching-year/2007/</p>


  <aside class="notes">

    Giving customers a choice of model is a 'feature' the feature is having lots of choice.

    FEATURES ARE BAD.

    Basically, if at any point in the last 10 years, you walked into a shop and say 'I want an iPhone, most of the time, you have a choice of "do you want the old model, or do you want the new model?", and then what colour/storage size.

    If you walked into a phone store in 2007 and said I want a Nokia, you have an overwhelming choice, which leads to people not being able to make a decision, and walking out without buying a phone.

    Good or bad? - telling the difference is hard.
  </h1>

  <p>A large part of being a programmer is making choices, whether it's what framework to use, what libraries to use or just how to structure code. Every day when we're programming we try to take choices that are good, and avoid choices that are bad.</p>

  <p>
    But what if actually we're all terrible at telling the difference between good and bad? What if we're all just not very good at a fundamental skill needed to do our jobs?</p>

  <p>In this talk I'm going to try to demonstrate a couple of common epistemological mistakes that people make, how you can try to analyze what is good and what is bad a bit better, and how to limit the consequences that come inevitably when bad choices are made.</p>
