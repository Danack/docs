# You're going to make bad decisions.

Making bad decisions is unavoidable.

I once worked in a company alongside a team of pretty clever people who couldn't come to accept this.

They'd managed to get themselves into a position where they were spending longer and longer analyzing problems, to try to make sure they delivered a solution that would cover all the requirements.

They'd gotten to the point where they were taking a week to plan a task that took a few days.

This is not a good place to be.

People think this is what the chart is like for whether they are going to make the right decision.

# chart that goes from 0 -> 99

We couldn't possibly spend zero time making a decision, that wouldn't be responsible.

But if we spend some time on it, we're quite likely to make the right decision


# Chart that goes from 50 -> 75





# Acknowledge your emotions when making decisions


# Ease of use over features



Hard to define exactly what is a feature and what is 'ease of use',
