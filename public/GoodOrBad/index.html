        iPod went on to sell 400 million units. There was something about the iPod that wasn't obviously great that made it sell lots.

      Okay - time for something more on topic for this evening.

      Some languages are crap.  Some languages are really just objectively crap. There is a language that most people in the room will be at least a little bit familiar with that is objectively crap, that somehow is widely used.

    Anyone know the language I'm talking about. No, not PHP, I'm actually thinking of English.

    English has a hilariously inconsistent. Other languages are much more consistent internally. A lot of this is due to English having taken ideas from other languages


    This is very similar to how PHP is not as consistent internally as it could be. This isn't from 'mistakes' this is from a decision to have thin wrappers around the underlying functions, so that people who are familiar with them can use them.

  <p>English lacks features.</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    English lacks features.  Features are great right? Having more features makes something better right?

    French has a feature. French has a feature where you can refer to someone formally with 'vous' or you can refer to them more informally.

    And features are great right? What could possibly be bad about having this feature. Well here is a simple chart about whether you should use tu or vous when talking to them
  </aside>
</section>


<!-- *************************** -->
<section>

  High-res version at twitter.com/MrDanack  Ha-ha self promotion.
  <aside class="notes">
    The problem with this feature is that you can piss people off by getting it wrong. Pretty obviously tu'ing someone when they think they deserve a vous would wind them up.

    But you can piss people off the other way round as well. My Dad has retired to Normandy, in France. My French is terrible, and I find it much easier to say s'il vous plait.....so I tend to just use that rather than trying to figure out of I should be using the vous or the tu form. My Dad's girlfriend got a bit annoyed once when I said "S'il vous plait" instead of switching to the informal s'il te plait.

    English doesn't have this feature. We used to have it, with the words 'thee' and 'thou' but they mostly fell out of use during the 1xth century, at least in part due to imported printing presses not having the letter 'thorn', but a y kind of looks like an off-centre thorn.


    Not having this feature means that anyone can go up to someone and talk to them without accidentally give them offense. I think this is actually a huge benefit in science and programming, where we can talk about 'your' idea, without someone taking umbrage.

    Less, "Yo! You want water?"; and more, "It's a warm day for a nice refreshment, no?"

  </p>

  <aside class="notes">
    Less amusingly several Asian languages have quite formal and deferential ways of phrasing words that should be used when a junior person talks to a more senior person, otherwise great offense can be taken. In everyday life this is fine......it turned out to be a bit of a problem for South Korean airlines.

    The problem was this; the co-pilot is junior to the pilot. However the co-pilot is also meant to challenge the pilot and point out any mistakes that the pilot has made. There were multiple flights where the co-pilot realised the captain had made a mistake, but brought it to their attentione with such deferential language that the captain didn't realise how serious the situation was.

    English almost doesn't have this feature - it's almost impossible to accidentally give offense to someone by using the wrong phrasing. "Thanks a bunch" -> "Thanks for nothing". "With all due respect" -> "I don't give a crap about your opinion.", "See you next Tuesday" -> this does not relate to a time.

            ----------



            -------------------

            PHP lacks features.

            PHP lacks threads. This means it's not possible to write programs that deadlock internally.

            Ruby has a feature.

            English can be understood through tough thorough thought though.

            English is also the most widely used language around the world, and is now pretty much a requirement for international business.

            PHP is the most widely used language for creating websites. (and tragically some companies are moving back to PHP).

        If you don't take away anything else from this talk, take this away.

        If something is objectively crap, but is still hugely successful you're using the wrong criteria to measure 'objective' good and bad.

      So what can we do if we're just rubbish at telling the difference between good and bad?


      Most obviously try to get better at it.

      Try and force yourself to look past big up front features, and pay more attention to small details that make like easier.

      Things that make life simpler + easier tend to be relatively more important than difficult to use features.

      I think the surface level features are relatively less important thank people think, and second level (or emergent) behaviour is relatively more important.

            Langauge consistency - easy to adopt new ideas. If nothing looks out of place, then adding new ideas doesn't make people feel surprised.

            Missing features - programmers don't need to learn those features. More seriously,

            Be prepared to be wrong. Particular around choosing libraries and frameworks....there is an incredibly high chance that whatever you choose is just not going to be the right choice....so write your code so that as much of it as possible is decoupled from _any_ library. (that includes your own libraries).

            (Brucie bonus - this is very likely to make your code easier to test as well).

            (a good way to measure this is to keep asking - if we removed this library how much of the other code would we need to alter - aka I fucking hate active record/eloquent.)

My newest favourite factoid about English. This is how the words would, should and could were spelled in the 15th century.

Would
Should
Coud

Would derives from
Should derives from
Coud derives from coude

Someone opened a bug report, asking for coud to be spelled similar to the other two for consistency. Most people agreed and just changed the spelling.
